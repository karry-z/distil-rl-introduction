## 📚 What This Is

<img src="docs/\_static/img/logo.png" align="right" width="40%"/>

As someone who's been learning reinforcement learning (RL), I've been searching for resources that strike the right balance. 

*Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction* is the bible of RL, but reading it cover-to-cover takes a ton of effort.  

That's why I created this tutorial: a streamlined "knowledge vault" to help you absorb the core ideas faster and easier!

## 🎯 Why This Project and how to use (for now)

> **💡 Key Idea:** This tutorial focuses on handpicked chapters from the RL Intro book and blends them with content from a [RL Coursera specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/reinforcement-learning) for a smoother learning experience.


> **🛠️ How to Use:** Read the whole tutorial on [this site](https://dong237.github.io/DistilRLIntroduction/). You will find more details about how this project came to exist and how to best use it in Chapter 0. The Prelude!
